# Meeting 11/21/2018

**Meeting Content:**
1. Decide on crossroad and car attributes
2. Decide on the update sequence
3. Decide the traffic behavior
4. Make the preliminary code for generating crossroad and car objects
5. Make the preliminary code for the update function
6. Create the python file, cross.py 

**Simulation Behavior Decision:**
1. Cars will be generated on the side randomly at first and then new cars will be generated at random time
2. Cars will be set with a predetermined route (exp: from crossroad 1 to crossroad 2 to crossroad 4 to crossroad 9, etc). But the route itself is random. The destination has to be different from the place where the car started
3. Some assumptions: every time step is 1 second. The length of the street is measured by the length of the car. The velocity of the car is the length of the car divided by the time
4. How the crossroad works:
    * The cars will contain its previous crossroad and its current crossroad. 
    * There are three types of states: pass in progress, queue before light (waiting queue), after light and before queueing
    * Pass in progress will go first, all cars’ status is updated and if they pass the crossroad, then, they will be popped out and become the third state: after light and before queueing. 
    * Queueing group will go next, popping the first car into the pass in progress
    * After light and before queueing group will go last. Cars will be closer to the next queue every time step and if it is close enough to the next queue, it will be added into the next queue
    * Each crossroad is linked by the edge (networkx module). Realized through a linked list


**Delegation:**
1. Visualization --- Chao
2. Detailed documentations --- Chao
3. Car generator (generate random cars at the side, path generator -- predetermine the car’s path through each node) --- Kaiying
4. Car destination stop -- if the car reaches the destination, then it should stop and disappear --- Kaiying
5. Crossroad signal generator --- Kaiying
